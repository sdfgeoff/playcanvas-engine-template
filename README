Playcanvas is great, but I like having everything local to my computer rather
than working in the cloud. I also don't like uploading assets every time
I change something. As a result, I developed this project template.
It has the following features:

 - Converts models from .blend format to playcanvas format
 - Nicely seperates source from output
 - Builds playcanvas for you (requires Node and npm)
 - can type 'make test' to open your project in a web browser.
